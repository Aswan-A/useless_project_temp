#  Click n Play üéØ


## Basic Details
### Team Name: J√§ger


### Team Members
- **Team Lead:** Aswan A - TKM College of Engineering, Kollam  
- **Member 2:** Prabhath VP - TKM College of Engineering, Kollam  


###  Project Description

**Click n Play** is a hilariously impractical video player where the video plays only as long as you keep clicking ‚Äî stop clicking, and it pauses. The faster you click, the smoother it plays.

It supports:
- üîó **YouTube URLs** ‚Äî Paste a link and stream directly.
- üåê **Direct Video Links** ‚Äî Enter a URL pointing to a video file.
- üìÅ **Local File Uploads** ‚Äî Upload and play your own videos one click at a time.

No autoplay, no controls ‚Äî just pure chaotic precision.


### The Problem (that doesn't exist)

Ever felt that modern video players are *too convenient*? With their smooth playback, autoplay, and pause buttons, it's just too easy to watch a video from start to finish without effort. Where‚Äôs the challenge? Where‚Äôs the physical exertion?

We realized what the world *truly* needed was a video player that requires continuous manual effort ‚Äî one that makes you *earn* every frame you watch.


### The Solution (that nobody asked for)

Introducing **Click n Play** ‚Äî a video player that flips convenience on its head. No autoplay. No timeline scrubbing. No fancy controls. Just a button that plays one frame every time you click.

Want to watch an entire movie? Start clicking. Want it to pause? Simply stop clicking. Whether you upload a video, paste a YouTube link, or drop a direct video URL ‚Äî everything runs on your clicks. It‚Äôs absurdly simple and needlessly difficult, just the way nobody wanted.

## Technical Details
### Technologies/Components Used

For Software:
- Languages: Python, JavaScript, HTML, CSS  
- Backend Framework: Flask  
- Libraries:  
  - `yt-dlp` for YouTube downloads  
  - `ffmpeg`/`ffprobe` for media metadata  
  - `requests` for URL proxying  
  - `flask_cors` for API access  
- Frontend: 
  - Canvas API for playback  
  - Custom UI toggling between upload, URL, or YouTube mode

### Implementation
For Software:
####  Backend (Flask)

- The backend is built using **Flask**, and serves APIs for:
  - Uploading and streaming local video files.
  - Accepting direct video links (e.g., `.mp4`) and proxy-streaming them.
  - Downloading and playing YouTube videos via `yt-dlp`.
- FPS and duration are extracted using `ffprobe`.
- Temporary video files are managed and cleaned periodically.
- All responses are CORS-enabled for cross-origin frontend communication.

#### Frontend (HTML + JS)

- Built using plain HTML, JavaScript, and `<canvas>` for rendering video.
- Users can select from three modes:
  - **Upload**: Choose a local video file to preview.
  - **Link**: Paste a direct video URL (e.g., from CDN or public video).
  - **YouTube**: Paste a YouTube link; it gets downloaded and played.
- Once loaded, videos don‚Äôt autoplay.
  - You must **keep clicking** to play the video frame-by-frame.
  - Stop clicking? The video freezes‚Äîlike a slideshow powered by your finger.
- A **"Remove File"** button appears once a file is selected, letting users clear the canvas and reset the state.

#### Libraries Used

- `Flask` ‚Äì for the backend server.
- `yt-dlp` ‚Äì for downloading YouTube videos.
- `ffmpeg/ffprobe` ‚Äì for extracting video metadata (FPS, duration).
- `requests` ‚Äì for handling direct video URL validation and proxying.
- Vanilla JS ‚Äì for frontend logic and canvas frame drawing.
